# API Design with Interceptors, Controllers, and Routes

This README file will discuss the concepts of interceptors, controllers, and routes, and how they can be used to design a well-organized and scalable API.

## Interceptors

Interceptors are classes that can be used to intercept requests and responses before or after they are processed by the API. Interceptors can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as:

- Authentication: Interceptors can be used to authenticate requests before they are processed.
- Authorization: Interceptors can be used to authorize requests before they are processed.
- Logging: Interceptors can be used to log requests and responses.
- Monitoring: Interceptors can be used to monitor requests and responses.
- Performance optimization: Interceptors can be used to optimize the performance of the API.

## Controllers

Controllers are classes that are responsible for handling requests and generating responses. Controllers are typically responsible for the following tasks:

- Parsing the request body
- Calling the appropriate service layer
- Generating the response body
- Formatting the response body

## Routes

Routes are used to map requests to controllers. Routes are typically defined in a configuration file.

## Best Design Principles

When designing an API, it is important to follow a number of best design principles. These principles include:

- Simplicity: The API should be easy to use and understand.
- Flexibility: The API should be flexible enough to meet the needs of a variety of users.
- Scalability: The API should be scalable to meet the demands of a growing user base.
- Security: The API should be secure from unauthorized access.
- Performance: The API should be performant and responsive.

## Conclusion

Interceptors, controllers, and routes are all important concepts in API design. By using these concepts, you can design a well-organized, scalable, and secure API.
